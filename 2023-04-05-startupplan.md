# Mitigating Hidden Risks of Large Language Models in the Insurance Industry: A SkepEmpircism Business Plan

## Executive Summary
SkepEmpircism.ai is a new startup focused on helping clients in the insurance industry detect hidden risks of large language models, specifically chatGPT. 
The increasing use of these models has led to an over-reliance on them, which can result in the fragility of the system and hidden model errors. Our startup offers an approach to identifying and addressing these risks based on a comparative psychology study, providing clients with the tools they need to mitigate the impact of model failures.

## Team
Our founders have worked in the insurance industry for many years and include experts in natural language processing, machine learning, and data analytics.
